# javaee8-jaxrs-sample(WIP)

> Check the latest [Jakarta EE REST Example](https://github.com/hantsy/jakartaee-rest-sample) project.

I have created [ a RESTful  API sample ](https://github/hantsy/angularjs-ee7-sample) to  demostrate how to build RESTful APIs with  Java EE 7 and JAX-RS 2.0.

In this sample, I will  rewrite it with the latest Java EE 8. I will use Glassfish v5 as target runtime, because  Java EE 8 supprt in other application servers are still under construction, as I know the newest Wildfly v11 still does not support Java EE 8, and IBM Open Liberty has began to add Java EE 8 features as its further rolling updates.   

The following specifications are used in this sample appliacation:

* JAX-RS 2.1
* JSON-P 1.1 and JSON-B 1.0
* JPA 2.2(and EJB, JTA) for database operations
* CDI 2
* Bean Validation 2
* Java EE Security 1.0


## What's it?

You have to use a blog system, a CMS like publishing platform etc. In this sample, I will demonstrate how to create a simple blog application.

* **backend** is the RESTful APIs, stateless, protected by JWT authentication.
* **frontend UI**, a Angular SPA applicatoin(in plan)

In the initial version, it could includes the following features:

* CRUD operation for post resouces
* Comment on a certtain post
* User can favorite/unfavorite a certain post


I have also created some some variants to demonstrate varied technology stack in the past, you can browse which you are interested in.
